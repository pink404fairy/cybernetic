 Welcome to Cybernetics Auto's world of possibilities, where every learning 
challenge becomes a stepping stone to your success! Cybernetics Auto Limited 
Company is based in Nairobi â€“ Kenya where we have a strong focus on 
enhancing teaching, learning, improving student outcomes, and streamlining 
school administrative tasks. 
Cybernetics Auto School Management is a cloud based system meaning, you can 
access it from anywhere, anytime. The platform helps streamline and simplify the 
administrative processes and operations involved within our basic education. We 
excel at giving teachers and administrators the tools and insights they need to 
monitor students' progress and foster a successful learning environment, this 
platform enables students to reach their full potential in their educational 
experience.
 We do believe that every student with the potential to excel academically 
deserves access to the necessary financial resources. A recent study by 
WorldRemit indicates that education cost for most households in Kenya is 
approximately 10 times their average monthly household income. Today, 
Cybernetics Auto Company has a resourceful solution for this where we plan 
to introduce a 
. It'll be a mobile based App 
School Fees Loans Issuance Program
 where parents can request up to 30% of the school fees to be paid directly to 
the school to help avoid student being rejected at school for lack of fees.
 We are also introducing  
related programs and tools to 
Artificial intelligence (AI)
 enhance our existing platforms and offer more to our students and teachers. We 
intend to use AI to help teachers overcome common classroom management 
challenges. Solutions provided by AI include more efficiently supporting students 
of various levels of ability simultaneously, providing enriching multimedia 
experiences beyond studying textbooks and providing personalized tutoring 
without reducing teacher bandwidth in an already crowded classroom.
 Welcome to our Pitch Deck as we review our programs and seek business 
partners who'll assist us financially and technically achieve our goals as we run 
this profit making ventures in Kenya.

SCHOOL MANAGEMENT PROBLEM STATEMENT
 Communication and Collaboration Problem 
Learning Institutions involve lots of communication and collaboration. Teachers, 
students, and parents have to be able to talk within their groups and also to one 
another. Cybernetics Auto solutions helps handle communication gaps within 
all parties. 
Student Data Analysis & Monitoring
 Teachers are struggling to watch student's activities including attendance, 
discipline and assignments, etc. School administrators are lacking in result-based 
monitoring tools to track student progress and their academic history.
 Paper-Based Processes
 Most aspects of addressing learning institutions involve some reasonable 
paperwork. Piles of records on admission, fees, attendance, academic 
performance, staff records, and other tasks are almost endless.
 Financial Management
 Budget constraints, fee collection and financial reporting can be challenging 
for school administrators. Inaccurate financial management may lead to 
resource shortages, affecting the quality of education and extracurricular 
activities.
 Technological Integration
 Many schools face difficulties in effectively integrating and utilizing technology 
for administrative tasks and educational purposes. All institutions need to stay 
current with technological advancements.
 Cybernetics Auto Resource Center
 Students will have access to quality e-learning resources administrator-approved 
lessons & materials in one space, teachers will spend more time effectively 
planning, instructing and engaging with students.

SCHOOL FEES LOAN PROGRAM
 BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
 Mobile loans are the most common form of credit in Kenya, accounting for 53% of all active 
loan accounts with a total balance of KES 165B ($1.3B). Kenyans are seeking mobile loans at 
a high rate due to a combination of economic pressures and the accessibility of digital lending 
platforms.  With a significant portion of the population facing low incomes and a rising cost of 
living resulting from inflation and global economic challenges, many turn to mobile loans to 
cover daily expenses, medical & school fees emergencies and small business needs. 
Empowering Your Educational Journey
 We believe that every student with the potential 
to excel academically deserves access to the 
necessary financial resources. Whether through 
private or public schooling, an uninterrupted 
quality education is worth the acquisition of a 
personal loan for school fees.

needs to develop, manage and operate this Mobile 
Based Loan App program and upon our research and 
development, we have the technology prerequisites 
and strategic formula to run it. This is an income generating business platform that when 
well-funded, managed with all legal, financial and risk management & mitigation well assessed 
has the capacity to IMPACT our communities positively and earn great REVENUE for all

approved, you'll receive the loan notification offer detailing the amount, repayment period, 
interest rate. If you confirm your commitment to our terms, the system proceeds to
